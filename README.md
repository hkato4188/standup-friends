### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you
can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function
should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your application first, and with a good level of detail. The
rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably routes next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
